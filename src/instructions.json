    "## How to play",
    "In this game, two players face off in a strategic contest to control the center of the board. The game board consists of two starting positions and a center area where the most action occurs. The center area has one central cell surrounded by three circles, each containing 20 cells.",
    "Each player starts with 15 pieces called :pawn, arranged in three rows of five pieces each. Pieces can move one step to any cell adjacent to their current cell that shares a common edge. The center cell is adjacent to all cells of the inner circle.",

    "![Pawn](images/pawn.png)",
    "If a piece moves to a cell occupied by an opponent's piece, that piece is captured and removed from the board.",

    "---",
    "### Promotions",
    "Pieces can be promoted to have a different role than the :pawn. Promotions can occur by reaching specific cells or by arranging pieces in specific formations.",
    "If three pieces are placed in a line on adjacent cells (either along the same line or within the same circle) and the middle piece of these three pieces has not been promoted and is not in the home area, it can be promoted to :horseman. The promotion takes one turn. The :horseman piece is marked by a :horseman_title symbol. It can move up to :horseman_steps steps at a time.",

    "---",
    "### Ranger",
    "If a piece reaches the :ranger promotion cell (a circular cell on the left side of the center area, marked by a :ranger_title), it is promoted to a :ranger automatically, without requiring a turn. The :ranger piece is marked by a :ranger_title symbol. This piece can move up to :ranger_steps steps and can jump over other pieces.",

    "---",
    "### Sentinel",
    "If a piece reaches the :sentinel promotion cell (a circular cell on the right side of the center area, marked by a :sentinel_title), it is promoted to a :sentinel automatically, also without requiring a turn. The :sentinel piece is marked by a :sentinel_title symbol and can move one step.",
    "![Sentinel](images/sentinel.png)",
    "---",
    "### Sentinel feature",
    "The :sentinel piece can revive a piece captured on the previous turn, provided the captured piece was adjacent to the :sentinel. This revival undoes the previous turn, restoring the captured piece and moving the opponent's piece back to its previous position. The revived piece cannot be captured on the next turn, and any promotion it held before capture is lost. Each player may only have one :sentinel piece at a time. If a :sentinel is captured, the player may promote another piece to become a :sentinel.",
    ":video",
    "---",
    "### Main objective",
    "The main objective of the game is to gain control of the center. This is accomplished by placing a promoted piece in the center and positioning any two pieces in opposite cells within the inner circle. This configuration must remain intact for one turn to secure victory. For the black player, victory is automatic since the turn ends after their move. The white player, however, must ensure that black cannot disrupt the configuration during their turn. This rule balances the slight speed advantage white has at the start of the game.",
    "![Winning position](images/winning.png)",
    "If either of the two pieces in the inner circle is captured and then revived by a :sentinel, the victory counter does not reset. However, if any of these pieces is moved, captured, and not revived, the counter resets.",

    "### Draw",
    "A draw is declared automatically if a player has fewer than three pieces remaining, as they can no longer achieve victory. A draw can also be declared at any time if both players agree."
